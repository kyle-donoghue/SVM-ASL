# Dataset

This project uses the following dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet

# Usage

The code requires the above dataset to be extracted into this folder, such that a training image would be: "REPO/dataset/asl_alphabet_train/asl_alphabet_train/A/A1.jpg"

Then, `export_images.py` should be used to create a pickle of all the images for faster loading in the real scripts.

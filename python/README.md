# Usage

The main file in this project is `hog_svm.py` and should be run with the desired static parameters defined at the top of the script. Other scripts, like `compare_training_size.py` and `view_snr.py` use pre-computed data to plot some useful information on the model.

This repository is not meant to be usable right out of the gate, due to missing models and datasets. These are up to the user to implement and compute.
